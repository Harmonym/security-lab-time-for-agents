## Delete your Azure resources

Most of the resources you created in this lab are pay-as-you-go resources, meaning you won't be charged any more for using them. However, some storage services used by AI Foundry may incur small ongoing charges. To delete all resources, follow these steps:

* Visit the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a>
* Click **Resource groups**
* Click on your resource group `rg-your named resource group-****`
* Click **Delete Resource group**
* In the field at the bottom "Enter resource group name to confirm deletion" enter `rg-your named resource group-****`
* Click **Delete**
  * At the Delete Confirmation prompt, click "Delete"
