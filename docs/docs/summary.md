# Summary

Congratulations for completing the lab! The goal of this workshop was to give you a chance to learn and practice how to build layered security & safety controls for agents. You should now be able to start experimenting with industry best practice techniques and tools on your own agent projects.

## Lab Index

- **Lab 1: SDL Instructions**  
  Learn how to set up Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) guidance for your AI pair programmer, including authoring and applying secure coding instructions to Copilot and agents at the repository level.

- **Lab 2: Constraints**  
  Define security-oriented system messages and behavioral constraints for your agent to reduce risk, craft strong safety-focused instructions, and configure your agent in Azure AI Foundry.

- **Lab 3: Safety Systems**  
  Implement layered security controls for your agent, including prompt shields, spotlighting, and content filters to detect adversarial attacks and block unsafe outputs.

- **Lab 4: Testing**  
  Use automated AI Red Teaming agents to adversarially test and evaluate your agent's resilience to novel threats and ensure established safety mechanisms are effective.

- **Lab 5: Logging**  
  Explore observability and logging requirements for agents, referencing schema options and OpenTelemetry conventions to capture actions, events, and compliance.

- **Lab 6: Monitoring & Alerting**  
  Integrate post-deployment monitoring and alerting solutions, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud, to detect anomalies, breaches, and security indicators specific to AI agents.

- **Optional Lab 7: Human in the Loop (HITL)**  
  Address the risks of inappropriate user reliance on AI, apply frameworks to foster appropriate trust, and design agent shut-down mechanisms and logging for critical interventions.

Just as generativeAI is a rapidly evolving technology space, so too are the threats and methods for protecting against them. Keep engaging with the security for AI community to continue your learning.
