# Meet the SparkMate agent

In this lab, you will be using a sample agent called **SparkMate** to practice building security and safety controls. The base of the agent has been created for you. Security and safety is highly contextual, so start by familiarizing yourself with agent scenario information outined below. It will be important to have a good understanding for the activities going forward so you can define the likely threats and types of behaviors that would be deemed unacceptable.

# Agent scenario

## Context
Contoso is a global company focused on building innovative products for professional sports teams. Each division is made up of feature teams that include a Product Manager, designers, engineers, and specialists—all working together to deliver high-impact solutions.
The Product Manager leads the charge in identifying new opportunities, shaping product strategy, and guiding the team through the product development lifecycle. Ideation is a critical part of this process, and live workshops are often used to bring diverse perspectives together.

## User Problem(s)

Teams often struggle to maintain momentum and structure during live brainstorming sessions, leading to missed opportunities and underdeveloped ideas.
Product Managers want to encourage creative thinking but also need to ensure ideas are aligned with business goals and user needs.
Participants sometimes feel unsure about how to contribute or how to build on others’ ideas effectively.
There’s a need for a consistent way to capture, clarify, and enhance ideas in real time, without slowing down the flow of the workshop.

The Brainstorming Collaborator Agent was designed to support live ideation workshops by guiding teams through structured creative exercises, asking thoughtful questions, and offering inspiring suggestions. 

It helps teams:

- Generate a wide range of ideas quickly
- Clarify and refine promising concepts
- Encourage inclusive participation
- Keep the session focused and productive

The agent can adapt to different workshop formats (in-person, remote, hybrid) and supports various ideation techniques like “How Might We” prompts, reverse brainstorming, and idea clustering. It also helps organize outputs for post-session review and prioritization.

## Questions to consider

- what are the user types you would envision interacting with and being effectved by this agent?
- what goals would you envision for this agentic system
- what information, access, and resources would it need to be effective?
