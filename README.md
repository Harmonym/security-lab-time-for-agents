# Build-an-Agent Labs: Safety & Security Edition

A comprehensive hands-on lab series for AI builders to implement safety and security techniques into custom agents. This lab covers essential security practices, Microsoft Safety System tools, and real-world testing methodologies.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these this session, you will learn to:
- Understand the top novel AI threats
- Apply Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) principles to AI agent development
- Implement effective behavior constraints 
- Integrate Microsoft safety system tools (prompt shield, spotlighting, task adherence)
- Test your agents using the AI red team agent
- Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting systems
- Design for appropriate reliance & human-in-the-loop (HITL)
